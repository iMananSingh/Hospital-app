### Fresh Admission Dialog Form Every Time (October 30, 2025 at 12:57 PM)
[x] Fixed admission dialog retaining previously entered data
- **Issue**: Opening admission dialog after previously closing it showed half-filled form with old data
- **User Request**: Dialog should be completely fresh/empty every time "Admit Patient" is clicked
- **Solution**:
  - Added `admissionForm.reset()` to clear all form fields when opening dialog
  - Clear selected services list: `setSelectedServices([])`
  - Clear service search query: `setSelectedServiceSearchQuery("")`
  - Then set fresh admission date/time to current moment
  - Applied to both "Admit Patient" button (lines 2166-2168) and "New Admission" button (lines 2707-2709)
- **Benefits**:
  - No leftover data from previous attempts
  - Clean slate every time you open the dialog
  - Prevents accidental submission of old/incorrect data
  - Better user experience with predictable form state
- **Files Modified**: `client/src/pages/patient-detail.tsx` (lines 2166-2168, 2707-2709)
- **Status**: Application restarted successfully, fix deployed ✓
- **Testing**: Open dialog → Fill partially → Close → Reopen → Should be completely empty

### Fresh Room Availability When Opening Admission Dialog (October 30, 2025 at 12:49 PM)
[x] Fixed stale room availability data in admission dialog
- **Issue**: After discharging a patient from room GW-04, immediately trying to admit a new patient showed that room as greyed out/unavailable
- **Root Cause**: Room availability and current admissions data were cached, not refreshing when dialog opened
- **Solution**:
  - Added query invalidation for `/api/rooms` and `/api/inpatients/currently-admitted` when opening admission dialog
  - Applied to both "Admit Patient" button (line 2189-2190) and "New Admission" button (line 2730-2731)
  - Fresh data is fetched every time the dialog opens
- **Benefits**:
  - Room shows as available immediately after patient discharge
  - No need to manually refresh page to see updated room availability
  - Always shows real-time accurate room occupancy status
- **Files Modified**: `client/src/pages/patient-detail.tsx` (lines 2189-2190, 2730-2731)
- **Status**: Application restarted successfully, fix deployed ✓
- **Testing Recommended**: Discharge patient → Open admission dialog → Room should be available

### Auto-Refresh After Patient Admission (October 30, 2025 at 12:37 PM)
[x] Added automatic page refresh after successful patient admission
- **User Request**: Auto-refresh page after admission is registered to show updated data
- **Implementation**:
  - Added `window.location.reload()` with 500ms delay after successful admission
  - Delay allows success toast message to be visible before refresh
  - Placed after all cache invalidation and dialog cleanup
- **Benefits**:
  - Page automatically shows newly created admission in timeline
  - User doesn't need to manually refresh to see changes
  - Clean user experience with visible success feedback
- **Files Modified**: `client/src/pages/patient-detail.tsx` (lines 1479-1482)
- **Status**: Application restarted successfully, feature deployed ✓
- **No Breaking Changes**: All existing functionality preserved

### Package Reinstallation - Twelfth Occurrence (October 30, 2025 at 12:33 PM)

- **Migration Status**: All items marked complete [x] ✓

### Pathology Receipt Numbering Fix - Final (October 30, 2025 at 9:24 AM)
[x] Fixed all pathology receipts showing "PAT-0001" regardless of order sequence
- **Issue**: All pathology test receipts were showing the same receipt number "PAT-0001" instead of incrementing properly (0001, 0002, 0003, etc.)
- **Root Causes (Two bugs found and fixed)**:
  1. **Date format mismatch**: Frontend sends `orderedDate` as "2025-10-30T14:51" (datetime), but count function was comparing this against dates stored as "2025-10-30" (date only), resulting in 0 matches
  2. **Off-by-one error**: Count function returns number of existing orders (e.g., 0, 1, 2), but we need count+1 for the next receipt number (0001, 0002, 0003)
- **Solution**:
  - Extract date-only part from `orderedDate` using `.split("T")[0]` before passing to count function (line 2825)
  - Add +1 to count to get correct next sequence number: `(count + 1)` (line 2833)
  - Applied same fixes to admission, room transfer, and discharge receipts for consistency
- **Files Modified**: `server/storage.ts` (lines 2825, 2833, 3643, 4374, 4501)
- **Status**: Application restarted successfully, fix deployed ✓
- **Testing**: 
  - First order of the day: count=0 → Receipt: 251030-PAT-0001 ✓
  - Second order: count=1 → Receipt: 251030-PAT-0002 ✓  
  - Third order: count=2 → Receipt: 251030-PAT-0003 ✓

### Admission Receipt Number Fix (October 30, 2025 at 8:29 AM)
[x] Fixed "Receipt No: RECEIPT-NOT-FOUND" showing in Admission Receipt
- **Issue**: Admission receipts were displaying "Receipt No: RECEIPT-NOT-FOUND" instead of the actual receipt number
- **Root Cause**: When building the consolidated admission event on patient-detail page, the code merged admission record with admit event details but did NOT include the `receiptNumber` from the admitEvent
- **Analysis**:
  - Backend correctly generates receipt number: `${yymmdd}-ADM-${admissionCount}` (e.g., "251030-ADM-0001")
  - Backend stores receipt number in admission_events table with eventType "admit" (line 3663)
  - Frontend extracts admit event and merges it with admission data (lines 3141-3163)
  - Frontend was copying admitEventNotes, admitEventTime, admitEventRoomNumber, admitEventWardType
  - Frontend was NOT copying the receiptNumber from admitEvent
- **Solution**:
  - Added `receiptNumber: admitEvent?.receiptNumber` to the consolidated admission event data (line 3154)
  - Now the receipt number from the admit event is properly passed through to the receipt generator
- **Files Modified**: `client/src/pages/patient-detail.tsx` (line 3154)
- **Status**: Application restarted successfully, fix deployed and hot-reloaded ✓

### Package Reinstallation - Eleventh Occurrence (October 30, 2025 at 8:26 AM)

- **Migration Status**: All items marked complete [x] ✓

### Room Transfer Timeline Display Fix (October 29, 2025 at 5:41 AM)
[x] Fixed "Previous Room" showing new room instead of previous room
- **Issue**: In patient detail timeline, room transfer events showed the NEW room under "Previous Room" label
- **Root Cause**: Code was displaying `event.data.admission?.currentRoomNumber` which is the updated/new room
- **Analysis**: 
  - Backend stores NEW room in `admission_events.roomNumber` field
  - Previous room information is in `notes` field: "Patient transferred from [Ward] ([Room]) to [Ward] ([Room])"
- **Solution**: 
  - Parse the `notes` field using regex to extract both previous and new room
  - Display both "Previous Room" and "New Room" separately for clarity
  - Format: "Room Number (Ward Type)" e.g., "ICU-01 (ICU)"
- **Files Modified**: `client/src/pages/patient-detail.tsx` (lines 3630-3673)
- **Status**: Application restarted successfully, fix deployed ✓

### Admission Card Title Room Display Fix (October 29, 2025 at 5:45 AM)
[x] Fixed "Patient Admitted" title showing current room instead of original admission room
- **Issue**: "Patient Admitted - ICU (ICU-01)" title updates to show NEW room after room transfers
- **Root Cause**: Title used `currentWardType` and `currentRoomNumber` from admission record, which gets updated during transfers
- **Analysis**:
  - Admission event merges admission record with admit event
  - Original room info exists in `admitEvent.roomNumber` and `admitEvent.wardType`
  - These fields were not being preserved in the merged event data
- **Solution**:
  - Store original room as `admitEventRoomNumber` and `admitEventWardType` when building timeline events
  - Update title to use these original values with fallback to current values for backwards compatibility
  - Title now shows: `Patient Admitted - ${admitEventWardType || currentWardType} (${admitEventRoomNumber || currentRoomNumber})`
- **Files Modified**: `client/src/pages/patient-detail.tsx` (lines 3149-3150, 3337)
- **Status**: Application restarted successfully, fix deployed ✓

### Discharge Card Room Information Enhancement (October 29, 2025 at 5:51 AM)
[x] Added room information to discharge event notes
- **Issue**: Discharge card notes showed generic "Patient discharged" without room information
- **User Request**: Include the room patient was discharged from (their last room)
- **Solution**:
  - Updated backend `dischargePatient` function to include room in notes
  - Notes now show: `Patient discharged from ${wardType} (${roomNumber})`
  - Uses `admission.currentWardType` and `admission.currentRoomNumber` (the last room before discharge)
- **Example**: "Patient discharged from ICU (ICU-01)"
- **Files Modified**: `server/storage.ts` (line 4478)
- **Status**: Application restarted successfully, enhancement deployed ✓

### Dashboard Activity Timestamp Timezone Fix (October 29, 2025 at 6:10 AM)
[x] Fixed activity timestamps showing 5.5 hours ahead (IST timezone issue)
- **Issue**: Dashboard "Recent Activities" showing times 5.5 hours ahead and not timezone-adjusted
- **Root Cause**: 
  - SQLite's `datetime('now')` returns "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS" format without timezone indicator
  - When JavaScript parses this, it treats it as local time instead of UTC
  - This caused a 5.5-hour offset for IST (UTC+5:30) timezone users
- **Solution**:
  - Updated `logActivity` function to explicitly set `createdAt` using `new Date().toISOString()`
  - This generates proper ISO 8601 format with 'Z' UTC indicator (e.g., "2025-10-29T05:51:30.000Z")
  - JavaScript now correctly parses timestamps as UTC and converts to user's local timezone
- **Impact**: 
  - All NEW activity logs will show correct timestamps
  - Existing activity logs may still show incorrect times (stored in old format before fix)
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `server/storage.ts` (line 5335 - added explicit createdAt)
  - `client/src/pages/dashboard.tsx` (lines 633-648 - added clarifying comments)
- **Status**: Application restarted successfully, timezone fix deployed ✓

[x] Fixed activity logging for permanent doctor deletion
- **Issue**: Activities were not being created when inactive doctors were permanently deleted
- **Root Cause**: Activity logging was inside storage function with potential userId validation issues
- **Solution**: Moved activity creation to route handler following same pattern as soft delete
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `server/routes.ts` - Added activity creation in permanent delete route
  - `server/storage.ts` - Removed duplicate activity logging from storage function
- **Testing**: Integration test confirmed activity is created with title "Doctor Permanently Deleted"

### Admission Events Timezone Fix (October 28, 2025 at 2:32 PM)
[x] Fixed event_time storage to strictly use UTC timestamps
- **Issue**: event_time column in admission_events table was storing local time instead of UTC
  - datetime-local inputs send values like "2025-10-28T15:00" without timezone information
  - Backend was not properly converting these to UTC before storage
  - Could cause issues with timezone-dependent features and data consistency
- **Root Cause**:
  - datetime-local format lacks timezone information
  - Previous code didn't validate or normalize timestamps before storage
  - No error handling for malformed date inputs
- **Solution**:
  - Implemented precision-aware datetime parsing for all input variants:
    - HH:MM format → append ":00.000Z"
    - HH:MM:SS format → append ".000Z"
    - HH:MM:SS.sss format → append "Z"
    - ISO with timezone → use as-is
    - Date only → append "T00:00:00.000Z"
  - All constructed strings validated through `new Date().toISOString()`
  - Added try/catch blocks with fallback to current time for invalid inputs
  - Consistent error handling across admission and discharge flows
- **Files Modified**:
  - `server/storage.ts` - Updated createAdmission() and dischargePatient() functions
- **Impact**:
  - All admission events (admit, discharge, room_change) now store UTC timestamps
  - Graceful degradation for malformed inputs instead of crashes
  - Receipt generation and sequencing remain accurate
  - Analytics and reporting will show correct UTC-normalized times
- **Architect Review**: Approved ✓
- **Testing**: Application running successfully with no errors ✓

### Backup & Restore Functionality Refactored (October 19, 2025 at 4:45 AM)
[x] Fixed critical backup and restore issues
- **Issue**: 
  - Backups were incomplete (missing 11+ database tables)
  - Restore functionality was broken (foreign key constraints, SQL parsing errors)
  - Users and all data were not being restored
- **Root Cause**:
  - Old SQL dump method only backed up 16 tables, missing activities, payments, earnings, etc.
  - Restore tried to DELETE with foreign keys enabled, causing failures
  - Poor error handling hid restore failures
- **Solution**:
  - Switched to file-based backup using SQLite's `VACUUM INTO` (backs up ENTIRE database)
  - New .db file format includes ALL tables, indexes, triggers automatically
  - Added backward compatibility for legacy .sql backups
  - Backup history now preserved across restores (merges old + new without duplicates)
  - Proper foreign key handling for legacy SQL restores
- **Files Modified**:
  - `server/storage.ts` - Refactored createBackup(), restoreBackup(), added restoreLegacySqlBackup(), updated getAvailableBackups()
- **Key Improvements**:
  - ✅ Complete database backup (all 27+ tables)
  - ✅ File-based restore (simple file copy, no SQL parsing)
  - ✅ Backward compatible with existing .sql backups
  - ✅ Backup history preserved forever across restores
  - ✅ Safety backup created before restore
  - ✅ Proper cleanup of temp files
  - ✅ Application auto-restarts after restore
- **Testing Status**: Code implemented, ready for user verification
- **Verification Needed**: User should test creating a new backup and restoring to verify functionality ✓
