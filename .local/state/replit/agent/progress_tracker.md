## Recent Updates

### Doctor Permanent Delete Activity Logging Fix (October 17, 2025 at 7:35 PM)
[x] Fixed activity logging for permanent doctor deletion
- **Issue**: Activities were not being created when inactive doctors were permanently deleted
- **Root Cause**: Activity logging was inside storage function with potential userId validation issues
- **Solution**: Moved activity creation to route handler following same pattern as soft delete
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `server/routes.ts` - Added activity creation in permanent delete route
  - `server/storage.ts` - Removed duplicate activity logging from storage function
- **Testing**: Integration test confirmed activity is created with title "Doctor Permanently Deleted"
- **Verification**: Activity record successfully stored in activities table ✓
