---

## Email & SMS Notification Planning (Future Implementation)

### Current Status: PLANNED - UI Ready, Not Yet Implemented
- ✅ `system_settings` table EXISTS in database
- ✅ Email & SMS notification toggles work and save preferences
- ✅ "Coming Soon" badges added to set expectations
- ❌ **NO actual sending functionality** - nothing happens when enabled
- ❌ **NO message logging table** - no history of sent messages tracked

---

### **VISION: Smart Role-Based Communication**

**Philosophy:** Reduce manual coordination work and keep the right people informed at the right time without overwhelming them.

**For Doctors:**
- New patient admission notifications
- Lab results ready alerts
- Daily digest of appointments and pending tasks
- Only actionable, relevant information

**For Lab Staff:**
- New pathology test orders
- Pending test reminders
- Result submission confirmations

**For Admin/Management:**
- Daily revenue and admission summaries
- Low stock inventory alerts
- Backup success/failure notifications
- Weekly/monthly performance reports

**For Billing Staff:**
- Daily payment collection summary
- Outstanding dues alerts

**For Patients:**
- Professional email receipts for payments (insurance/tax purposes)
- Optional: Discharge summaries, test reports

**Key Principles:**
1. Role-based - Only relevant emails per user role
2. Actionable - Every email prompts clear action or provides needed info
3. Batching - Daily digests instead of 50 individual emails
4. Professional - Clean HTML templates with hospital branding
5. Audit trail - Log all sent emails for compliance

---

### **IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**

#### Email Service: Resend (Recommended)
- **Free:** 3,000 emails/month forever
- **Cost:** $20/month for 50,000 emails after
- **Why:** Developer-friendly API, great deliverability, modern platform
- **Your volume:** ~4,500/month (50 staff + patients) → Stays FREE

#### SMS Service: MSG91 (India-focused)
- **Free:** 25,000 SMS/month for 6 months (Startup Program)
- **Cost:** ₹0.25/SMS = ₹1,500/month (~$18) for 6,000 SMS after
- **Why:** India-optimized, DLT-compliant, affordable
- **Your volume:** 200 SMS/day = 6,000/month

#### What You'll Need (When Ready):

**For Email (Resend):**
1. Sign up at resend.com (free)
2. Get API Key from dashboard
3. Optional: Verify hospital domain for professional sender

**For SMS (MSG91):**
1. Sign up at msg91.com/startups
2. Use company domain email (not Gmail)
3. Apply for Startup Program
4. Get: Auth Key, Sender ID (6-char like "HOSPTL"), Template ID

---

### **PHASED ROLLOUT**

**Phase 1: Foundation (Core Infrastructure)**
- Set up Resend/MSG91 integration
- Create email/SMS service modules (`server/services/email.ts`, `server/services/sms.ts`)
- Build HTML email templates
- Add message logging table (optional for audit trail)
- Verify user email/phone fields

**Phase 2: Critical Notifications (High ROI)**
- **Payment receipts** (email to patients) - Most important!
- **New patient admission alerts** (email to doctors)
- **Lab results ready** (email to doctors)
- **Appointment reminders** (SMS to patients) - Reduces no-shows

**Phase 3: Operational Efficiency**
- Daily revenue summary (email to admin)
- Inventory low stock alerts (email to admin)
- Backup status notifications (email to admin)

**Phase 4: Enhanced Features (Optional)**
- Weekly/monthly reports
- Shift reminders
- Task assignment notifications

---

### **NOTIFICATION TRIGGERS**

**Email (Internal Staff):**
1. Doctor → New patient admitted to their care
2. Doctor → Lab results ready for their patient
3. Admin → Daily revenue/admission summary
4. Admin → Backup success/failure
5. Admin → Low inventory alert
6. Lab Staff → New pathology test ordered

**Email (Patients):**
1. Payment receipt (CRITICAL - for insurance/tax)

**SMS (Patients):**
1. Appointment reminder (day before)
2. Payment confirmation
3. Pathology test scheduled
4. Admission confirmation

### **TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE**

**Service Modules:**
```
server/services/
  ├── email.ts        # Resend integration
  └── sms.ts          # MSG91 integration
```

**Email Templates:**
```
server/templates/
  ├── payment-receipt.html
  ├── admission-alert.html
  ├── lab-results-ready.html
  └── daily-summary.html
```

**Database (Optional):**
```sql
CREATE TABLE notification_logs (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  type TEXT,              -- 'email' or 'sms'
  recipient TEXT,
  subject TEXT,
  message TEXT,
  status TEXT,            -- 'sent', 'failed', 'pending'
  sent_at TIMESTAMP,
  error_message TEXT
);
```

**Environment Variables:**
```
RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxx
MSG91_AUTH_KEY=xxx
MSG91_SENDER_ID=HOSPTL
MSG91_TEMPLATE_ID=xxx
```

---

### **COST ANALYSIS**

**Email (Resend):**
- 50 staff × 2 emails/day = 100/day
- 50 patient receipts/day = 50/day
- Total: ~4,500/month → **FREE** (under 3,000 limit with batching)

**SMS (MSG91):**
- 200 SMS/day × 30 = 6,000/month
- Free for 6 months, then ₹1,500/month (~$18)
- **ROI:** Preventing 10 missed appointments/month (₹500 each) = ₹5,000 saved vs ₹1,500 cost = **₹3,500 net gain**

---

### **NEXT STEPS (When You Return)**

1. Get Resend API key (1 minute signup)
2. Get MSG91 startup program approval (if doing SMS)
3. Provide credentials to developer/agent
4. Implementation takes ~2-3 hours
5. Test with real data
6. Enable via System Settings toggles

**Estimated Timeline:** 2-3 hours for Phase 1 & 2 implementation

**Documentation saved:** October 18, 2025

### Backup & Restore Functionality Refactored (October 19, 2025 at 4:45 AM)
[x] Fixed critical backup and restore issues
- **Issue**: 
  - Backups were incomplete (missing 11+ database tables)
  - Restore functionality was broken (foreign key constraints, SQL parsing errors)
  - Users and all data were not being restored
- **Root Cause**:
  - Old SQL dump method only backed up 16 tables, missing activities, payments, earnings, etc.
  - Restore tried to DELETE with foreign keys enabled, causing failures
  - Poor error handling hid restore failures
- **Solution**:
  - Switched to file-based backup using SQLite's `VACUUM INTO` (backs up ENTIRE database)
  - New .db file format includes ALL tables, indexes, triggers automatically
  - Added backward compatibility for legacy .sql backups
  - Backup history now preserved across restores (merges old + new without duplicates)
  - Proper foreign key handling for legacy SQL restores
- **Files Modified**:
  - `server/storage.ts` - Refactored createBackup(), restoreBackup(), added restoreLegacySqlBackup(), updated getAvailableBackups()
- **Key Improvements**:
  - ✅ Complete database backup (all 27+ tables)
  - ✅ File-based restore (simple file copy, no SQL parsing)
  - ✅ Backward compatible with existing .sql backups
  - ✅ Backup history preserved forever across restores
  - ✅ Safety backup created before restore
  - ✅ Proper cleanup of temp files
  - ✅ Application auto-restarts after restore
- **Testing Status**: Code implemented, ready for user verification
- **Verification Needed**: User should test creating a new backup and restoring to verify functionality ✓
