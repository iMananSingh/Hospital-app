PS F:\Projects\HMSync App> fly certs add hmsync.healthcare.mandla.com -a hmsync-newhch-mandla

You are creating a certificate for hmsync.healthcare.mandla.com
We are using Let's Encrypt for this certificate.

You can direct traffic to your Fly application by adding records to your DNS provider.

Choose your DNS setup:

1. A and AAAA records (recommended for direct connections)

   A    hmsync.healthcare → 66.241.125.221
   AAAA hmsync.healthcare → 2a09:8280:1::b3:1be3:0

2. CNAME record

   CNAME hmsync.healthcare → knrwe3g.hmsync-newhch-mandla.fly.dev

3. External proxy setup

   AAAA hmsync.healthcare → 2a09:8280:1::b3:1be3:0

   Use this setup when configuring a proxy or CDN in front of your Fly application.
   When proxying traffic, you should only use your application's IPv6 address.

Optional: DNS Challenge

   CNAME _acme-challenge.hmsync.healthcare.mandla.com → hmsync.healthcare.mandla.com.knrwe3g.flydns.net

   Additional to one of the DNS setups.
   Required for wildcard certificates, or to generate
   a certificate before directing traffic to your application.


Once your DNS is configured correctly, we will automatically provision your certificate.
Run fly certs check hmsync.healthcare.mandla.com to check the progress.
